    DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING USING MATLAB

--------------------------------------

           By Proakis and Ingle, 1995



MS-DOS Diskette Contents

------ -------- --------

The diskette contains all Matlab functions developed in the accompanying

book.  These functions, which can be treated as a new DSP toolbox, are

available in the subdirectory "pws_dsp".  This toolbox can be used either in

book exercises or for general signal processing operations.  Place this toolbox

as a subdirectory in your Matlab Toolbox directory and place its reference in

the MATLABPATH environment variable. This can be done by editing your

matlabrc.m file in the MATLAB directory.



This diskette also contains all Matlab script files used in Chapter

Examples.  These files are available in each chapter subdirectory.  It is not

necessary to reference each subdirectory in the MATLABPATH environment.  The

best approach is to make each subdirectory as a current directory (using the

"chdir" command) when you want to use or modify scripts.



Finally, some figures generated in the book using Matlab are also provided

as script files for learning experience.  These are available in the "figures"

directory.



The overall directory structure is as follows:



  DIRECTORY                           COMMENTS
